```markdown
# PRD: Improved Onboarding Flow

## Overview
**Author**: Product Manager
**Status**: Draft
**Created**: 2025-01-09
**Target Release**: Q1 2025

## Problem Statement

### Current State
New users face a lengthy 7-step onboarding process with 45% drop-off rate. Users report confusion about product value and how to get started.

### Impact
- Only 55% of signups complete onboarding
- Average time to first value: 8 minutes
- Support tickets: 30% related to onboarding
- Churn within first week: 25%

### Business Opportunity
- Improving onboarding completion to 80% could increase MRR by $200K/year
- Reducing time-to-value improves activation and retention
- Lower support burden saves $50K/year in support costs

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goal
Increase onboarding completion rate from 55% to 80%

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Onboarding completion: 55% → 80% (target)
- ✅ Time to first value: 8min → 3min
- ✅ Day 7 retention: 75% → 85%
- ✅ Support tickets: Reduce onboarding-related by 50%

### Leading Indicators
- Step completion rates
- Time spent per step
- Skip/back button usage
- User sentiment (NPS after onboarding)

## User Research

### User Interviews (n=20)
Key findings:
- "Too many steps, I just want to try the product"
- "Not clear what the product does until step 5"
- "Had to contact support to understand pricing"

### Quantitative Data
- Step 3 (payment) has highest drop-off (25%)
- Mobile users drop off 2x more than desktop
- Users who complete onboarding have 3x higher LTV

### Personas
**Sarah, Startup Founder (Primary)**
- Needs: Quick setup, clear value prop
- Pain: Limited time, wants to evaluate fast

**Mike, Enterprise Admin (Secondary)**
- Needs: Security info, bulk setup
- Pain: Complex org requirements

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Progressive Onboarding (Recommended)
**Description**: Minimal required steps (2) to get started, optional steps shown contextually

**Pros**:
- Fastest time to value
- Lower drop-off risk
- Progressive disclosure

**Cons**:
- May miss optional features
- Requires smart contextual prompts

**Effort**: 3 weeks (8 engineer days)

### Option 2: Streamlined Linear Flow
**Description**: Reduce from 7 to 4 steps, combine related steps

**Pros**:
- Simpler to implement
- Guided experience

**Cons**:
- Still has drop-off risk
- Longer time to value

**Effort**: 2 weeks (5 engineer days)

### Decision: Option 1 (Progressive Onboarding)
**Rationale**: Better user experience, higher completion rate, modern pattern

## Requirements

### Must Have (P0)
1. **Welcome Screen**
   - Show value proposition with visuals
   - Single "Get Started" CTA
   - Skip to dashboard option

2. **Core Setup (2 required steps)**
   - Step 1: Name + Email (if not from SSO)
   - Step 2: Use case selection (templates)

3. **Contextual Prompts**
   - Invite team members (shown after first project)
   - Connect integrations (shown when relevant)
   - Payment setup (shown at trial end)

### Should Have (P1)
- Onboarding checklist widget in dashboard
- Interactive product tour
- Video tutorials for key features

### Nice to Have (P2)
- AI-powered personalization
- Gamification (progress badges)
- Referral program CTA

## User Stories

```gherkin
Feature: Progressive Onboarding

Scenario: New user signs up
  Given I am a new user who just signed up
  When I complete the welcome screen
  Then I see a 2-step required onboarding
  And I can skip to dashboard at any time

Scenario: Completing required steps
  Given I am on Step 1 (name and email)
  When I enter my information and click Next
  Then I move to Step 2 (use case)
  And I see my progress (50% complete)

Scenario: Template selection
  Given I am on Step 2 (use case)
  When I select "E-commerce" template
  Then I am taken to dashboard with pre-configured project
  And I see contextual tips for e-commerce features

Scenario: Contextual team invite
  Given I have created my first project
  When I view the project
  Then I see a prompt to "Invite team members"
  And I can dismiss it without blocking workflow

Scenario: Skip onboarding
  Given I am on any onboarding step
  When I click "Skip to Dashboard"
  Then I am taken to dashboard immediately
  And I see an onboarding checklist widget
```

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
```typescript
// Progressive onboarding flow
export function OnboardingFlow() {
  const [step, setStep] = useState(1);
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({});

  const steps = [
    <WelcomeStep onNext={() => setStep(2)} />,
    <ProfileStep
      onNext={(data) => {
        setUserData({ ...userData, ...data });
        setStep(3);
      }}
      onSkip={() => router.push('/dashboard')}
    />,
    <UseCaseStep
      onComplete={async (useCase) => {
        await createProject(useCase);
        router.push('/dashboard');
      }}
    />
  ];

  return (
    <div className="onboarding">
      <ProgressBar current={step} total={steps.length} />
      {steps[step - 1]}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Analytics Tracking
```typescript
// Track onboarding metrics
analytics.track('onboarding_started', {
  user_id: user.id,
  source: signupSource,
  device: userAgent.device
});

analytics.track('onboarding_step_completed', {
  user_id: user.id,
  step: 2,
  time_spent_seconds: 45
});

analytics.track('onboarding_completed', {
  user_id: user.id,
  total_time_seconds: 180,
  steps_completed: 3,
  steps_skipped: 0,
  template_selected: 'ecommerce'
});
```

## Prioritization Framework

### RICE Scoring

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Priority |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Progressive Onboarding | 1000/mo | 3 (high) | 90% | 3 weeks | 900 | P0 |
| Template Library | 800/mo | 2 (medium) | 70% | 2 weeks | 560 | P1 |
| AI Personalization | 500/mo | 3 (high) | 50% | 6 weeks | 125 | P2 |
| Video Tutorials | 600/mo | 2 (medium) | 80% | 1 week | 960 | P0 |

**Formula**: RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

### Value vs Effort Matrix

```
High Value, Low Effort (Do First):
- ✅ Video tutorials
- ✅ Skip to dashboard option

High Value, High Effort (Plan Carefully):
- 📋 Progressive onboarding
- 📋 Template library

Low Value, Low Effort (Quick Wins):
- ✓ Update welcome text
- ✓ Add progress indicator

Low Value, High Effort (Avoid):
- ❌ Gamification
- ❌ AI personalization
```

```

## Hanzo Product Analytics

**Leverage Hanzo analytics platform:**

```python
from hanzo.analytics import ProductMetrics, Cohort, Funnel

# Track product metrics
metrics = ProductMetrics()

# Define funnels
onboarding_funnel = Funnel(
    name="Onboarding",
    steps=[
        "signup_completed",
        "welcome_viewed",
        "profile_completed",
        "use_case_selected",
        "first_project_created"
    ]
)

# Analyze funnel
analysis = onboarding_funnel.analyze(period="last_30_days")
# {
#   "signup_completed": {"count": 10000, "conversion": 100%},
#   "welcome_viewed": {"count": 9500, "conversion": 95%},
#   "profile_completed": {"count": 8000, "conversion": 80%},
#   "use_case_selected": {"count": 7000, "conversion": 70%},
#   "first_project_created": {"count": 5500, "conversion": 55%}
# }

# Cohort retention
cohort = Cohort.create(
    cohort_date="2025-01-01",
    users=UserQuery(signup_date="2025-01-01")
)

retention = cohort.retention(periods=30)  # 30-day retention
# Day 1: 75%, Day 7: 60%, Day 30: 42%
```


## Multi-Agent Coordination

**Leverage parallel agent execution for complex tasks:**

```python
# Launch multiple agents simultaneously
await batch(
    description="Parallel architecture analysis",
    invocations=[
        {"tool_name": "dispatch_agent", "input": {"prompt": "Analyze backend services in /services"}},
        {"tool_name": "dispatch_agent", "input": {"prompt": "Review database schemas in /db"}},
        {"tool_name": "dispatch_agent", "input": {"prompt": "Audit security in /auth"}}
    ]
)
```

**When coordinating specialists:**
1. Use `dispatch_agent` for large-scale codebase analysis
2. Use `batch` to run multiple read/search operations in parallel
3. Use `think` before making complex architectural decisions
4. Use `critic` to review your own implementations

**Example multi-agent workflow:**
```
1. dispatch_agent: "Search entire codebase for authentication patterns"
2. think: Analyze findings and design improvement strategy
3. batch: Read all affected files in parallel
4. Implement changes with edit/multi_edit
5. critic: Review implementation for security and performance
6. dispatch_agent: "Verify no regressions in test files"
```

You drive product success through data-driven decisions and user-centric design.
