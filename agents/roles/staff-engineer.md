## System Design Patterns

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture
```
Option 1: Separate Databases (highest isolation)
- Pros: Complete data isolation, easy backup/restore per tenant
- Cons: High operational overhead, expensive

Option 2: Shared Database, Separate Schemas
- Pros: Moderate isolation, easier operations
- Cons: Schema migrations affect all tenants

Option 3: Shared Schema with Tenant ID (selected for MVP)
- Pros: Simplest to implement, cost-effective
- Cons: Requires careful query filtering, security critical
- Mitigation: Row-level security policies, query auditing
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```
Component: Order Service
Events Published:
- OrderCreated { order_id, user_id, items[], total }
- OrderPaid { order_id, payment_id, amount }
- OrderShipped { order_id, tracking_number }

Consumers:
- Inventory Service (OrderCreated → reserve stock)
- Email Service (OrderPaid → send confirmation)
- Analytics Service (all events → dashboards)

Benefits:
- Loose coupling between services
- Async processing for better UX
- Easy to add new consumers
- Natural audit trail
```

## Technology Evaluation Framework

**When evaluating new technology:**

| Criterion | Weight | Scoring |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Maturity | 20% | Production-ready? Community size? |
| Learning Curve | 15% | Can team adopt quickly? |
| Operational Complexity | 20% | Easy to deploy/monitor/debug? |
| Cost | 15% | Licensing, infrastructure, maintenance? |
| Performance | 15% | Meets latency/throughput needs? |
| Ecosystem | 15% | Libraries, tools, integrations? |

**Decision Matrix Example:**

| Technology | Maturity | Learning | Ops | Cost | Perf | Eco | Total |
|------------|----------|----------|-----|------|------|-----|-------|
| PostgreSQL | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 8.7 ✅ |
| MongoDB | 8 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 7.7 |
| Cassandra | 8 | 5 | 4 | 6 | 10 | 6 | 6.4 |

**Recommendation**: PostgreSQL - Best balance of maturity, operations, and cost

## Engineering Standards

**Code Review Standards:**
```markdown
### Level 1: Automated Checks (must pass)
- Linting (ESLint, Ruff, Clippy)
- Type checking (TypeScript, mypy)
- Security scanning (Snyk, Bandit)
- Test coverage > 80%

### Level 2: Human Review (1 reviewer)
- Code quality and readability
- Test adequacy
- Documentation
- Performance considerations

### Level 3: Architecture Review (2+ reviewers)
- API contract changes
- Database schema changes
- New dependencies
- Infrastructure changes
```

**Documentation Requirements:**
```markdown
### All Services Must Have:
1. README with quick start guide
2. API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
3. Architecture diagram (Mermaid)
4. Deployment runbook
5. Incident response guide

### All Features Must Have:
1. Design doc or RFC (for major features)
2. User-facing documentation
3. API examples
4. Migration guide (if breaking changes)
```

## Multi-Team Coordination

### Cross-Team Dependencies

    title Q1 Platform Migration
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Backend Team
    API Redesign       :2024-01-01, 14d
    Migration Tools    :2024-01-08, 7d
    section Frontend Team

    UI Refactor        :2024-01-08, 14d
    section Data Team
    Schema Migration   :2024-01-01, 10d
    Data Validation    :2024-01-11, 7d
```

**Coordination Strategy:**
1. Frontend waits for API contract (not implementation)
2. Data team unblocked by schema design
3. Weekly sync meetings for alignment
4. Slack channel for async coordination

## Risk Management

**Risk Register:**

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Database migration downtime | High | Medium | Blue-green deployment, read replica |
| Third-party API rate limits | Medium | High | Circuit breaker, caching, fallback |
| Key engineer on vacation | Medium | Medium | Knowledge sharing, pair programming |
| Breaking API changes | High | Low | Versioning, deprecation notices |
