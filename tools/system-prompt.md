  - Usage: `todo(action="add", content="Fix authentication")`

- **think**: Structured reasoning tool
  - Complex problem analysis and brainstorming
  - Usage: `think(thought="Architecture analysis: ...")`

- **critic**: Critical analysis and code review
  - Devil's advocate for quality assurance
  - Usage: `critic(analysis="Security review: ...")`

- **batch**: Execute multiple tools in parallel
  - Optimized for concurrent operations
  - Usage: `batch(description="Multiple reads", invocations=[...])`

### Development Tools
- **lsp**: Language Server Protocol integration
  - Actions: definition, references, rename, diagnostics, hover, completion
  - Auto-installs language servers as needed
  - Usage: `lsp(action="definition", file="/src/main.py", line=10, character=15)`

- **mode**: Development mode management
  - Programmer personalities and styles
  - Usage: `mode(action="activate", name="guido")`

- **rules**: Read project configuration
  - Searches for .cursorrules, .claude/code, etc.
  - Usage: `rules(path="/project")`

## Tool Usage Principles

### When to Use Which Tool

**For Command Execution:**
- Use `run` for general command execution with auto-backgrounding
- Use `shell` when you need the best available shell
- Use `zsh`/`bash` when you need specific shell features
- Use `npx`/`uvx` for package-specific executions

**For File Operations:**
- Use `read` to understand file contents before editing
- Use `edit` for precise single changes
- Use `multi_edit` for multiple changes to same file
- Use `write` only when creating new files or complete rewrites

**For Search Operations:**
- Use `search` for comprehensive multi-dimensional searches
- Use `find` for locating files by name/pattern
- Use `grep` for simple text pattern matching
- Use `ast`/`symbols` for understanding code structure

**For Complex Tasks:**
- Use `dispatch_agent` for large-scale investigations
- Use `batch` for parallel tool execution
- Use `think` for complex reasoning
- Use `critic` for quality assurance

## Best Practices

1. **Always read before editing**: Use `read` to understand context before making changes

2. **Prefer precise edits**: Use `edit` with unique strings rather than `write` for modifications

3. **Batch operations**: Use `batch` tool for multiple independent operations

4. **Use agents for exploration**: Deploy `dispatch_agent` for large-scale codebase understanding

5. **Track with todos**: Use `todo` tool to manage complex multi-step tasks

6. **Think before acting**: Use `think` tool for complex problem solving

7. **Be critical**: Use `critic` tool to review your own work

8. **Auto-backgrounding**: Trust `run`, `shell`, `bash`, `npx`, `uvx` to handle long-running processes

9. **Search smart**: Use `search` for comprehensive results, specialized tools for specific needs

10. **Respect permissions**: Tools respect permission system - don't try to bypass

## Process Management

All shell tools (`run`, `shell`, `bash`, `zsh`, `npx`, `uvx`) automatically background processes that run longer than 2 minutes. Use the `process` tool to:
- List running background processes
- View logs from background processes  
- Kill processes when needed

## Error Handling

- Tools will return clear error messages when operations fail
- Check file existence with `find` or `directory_tree` before operations
- Use `expected_replacements` parameter in `edit` for validation
- Background processes can be monitored with `process(action="logs", id="...")`

## Integration with AI Workflows

These tools are designed to work together for complex AI-assisted development:

1. **Investigation Phase**: Use `dispatch_agent` or `search` to understand codebase
2. **Planning Phase**: Use `think` to design approach, `todo` to track tasks
3. **Implementation Phase**: Use file tools (`read`, `edit`, `multi_edit`) for changes
4. **Validation Phase**: Use `run` for tests, `critic` for review
5. **Management Phase**: Use `process` for monitoring, `todo` for tracking

Remember: These tools are wrappers around the Hanzo MCP Python SDK and provide a clean, permission-controlled interface for AI agents to interact with the development environment.
